## Mission Brief

Greetings, Space Engineer! Your mission is to establish a Kubernetes outpost in your personal AWS  Galaxy using Terraform and deploy the 

crucial "Space Beacon" microservice using Helm.

---

## Mission Tools

Please refer to the [Mission Log](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html) for a detailed log of our journey, including the 

steps taken, decisions made, and any encountered cosmic anomalies.

## Instructions

To successfully accomplish our mission, follow the steps below:

## Step 1: Establishing the Outpost

Review the Terraform Script guide.
Set up your AWS credentials and ensure you have the necessary permissions.
Clone this repository and navigate to the Terraform directory.
Update the desired variables and configurations in the Terraform script.
Initialize the Terraform project by running terraform init.
Apply the Terraform configuration by running terraform apply.
Retrieve the outpost coordinates (kubeconfig) provided in the Terraform output.

## Step 2: Dockerizing the Space Beacon

Review the Dockerfile guide.
Choose your desired programming language.
Create a Dockerfile with the necessary configurations for the Space Beacon microservice.
Build the Docker image by running docker build -t space-beacon:latest ..
Push the Docker image to a container registry of your choice (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).

--- 


## Step 3: Helm Chart for the Space Beacon

Review the Helm Chart guide.
Customize the Helm chart to fit your requirements.
Deploy the Space Beacon to the EKS cluster using the Helm chart by running helm install space-beacon ./space-beacon.
